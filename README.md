# Competitive CNN Model for CIFAR-10 Classification

 

📋 Overview

This repository contains a simple yet highly competitive Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture designed for the CIFAR-10 image classification task. The model achieves excellent performance with a minimal parameter budget (~118k parameters) while maintaining high accuracy (92%) and low cross-entropy loss, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices.

✨ Highlights
	•	🔍 Small Footprint: Only 118,258 parameters (under 100KB model file size in HDF5 format).
	•	📈 High Accuracy: Achieved 92.63% validation accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
	•	📉 Low Cross-Entropy Loss: Final validation CE loss of 0.23.
	•	🚀 Efficient and Fast: Can be trained on consumer-grade GPUs (or even Google Colab) in reasonable time.
	•	🧩 Layer-wise simplicity: Uses batch normalization, dropout, and global average pooling to prevent overfitting while maintaining model generalization.
	•	💡 Easy to customize and extend: Great baseline for model compression, pruning, or quantization research.
